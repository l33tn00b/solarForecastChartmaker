Generate an Image from DWD Solar Forecast Data for ePaper Display.  

You get it. This is going to be a container serving a chart containing solar forecast data for display on an ePaper.
It is based off (original Python script): https://www.photovoltaikforum.com/thread/144350-kostenlose-wetterprognose-pv-prognose-ertragsprogonse-mit-st%C3%BCndlicher-aufl%C3%B6sung/ 

## Why?
You might want to know when to empty your battery because it will be full at the end of the day, anyway.

## Problems?
None.
